### 1. Description  

**What is this project?**  
* An application for users to search and save books sing GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH API

**Why this project?**  
* Online research is common practice for a range of products.  Books are no different.  Users want to be abe to read about a book before they purchase it.   This site will allow users to be able to search for books and read a blurb about them to see if they want to save them to a list.  This could be used for a  range of things and a useful way of learning about saving to daatabases in a mern project
